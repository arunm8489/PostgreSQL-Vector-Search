    "## What is Hybrid search?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid search merges different search methods to enhance result quality.It is a combination of keyword search with semantic search. Suppose a user searches  \"Italian recipes with tomato sauce\" , if we are using keyword search it would just bring text with words italian,reciepies,tomato or sause. But in many cases it fails to bring some dishes which is italian with tomato as incredient but those keywords are not present.Similarly if we are just using semantic search, it may bring reciepies like mexican salsa recipie and not what the user is looking for. In such cases hybrid search can be a good option to go.Hybrid search combines the strengths of both these methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use hybrid search?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to use hybrid search depends on what your users are looking for in your app. \n",
    "- For a code repository where developers need to find exact lines of code or error messages, keyword search is likely ideal because it matches specific terms. \n",
    "- In a mental health form, where user express about their feelings, semantic search will be agood option.\n",
    "- For a shopping app where customers might search for specific product names yet also be open to related suggestions, hybrid search  would be agood option.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some key advantages of using hybrid search**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision: Keyword search enables exact matches to the query, leaving no room for ambiguity. \n",
    "- Context: Semantic search allows algorithms to understand the intent of the query. If no keywords are matched, the semantic search will step in to analyze the context and meaning behind the query, ensuring that relevant results are still provided and covering any gaps in keyword-based matching.\n",
    "- Relevance: Both techniques complement each other and improve relevance for unseen queries.\n",
