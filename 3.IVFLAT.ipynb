    "- It works by dividing vetors in the table in to multiple list. In other words we can say it will divide the vectors in the table in to multiple clusters.\n",
    "- Here the algorithm will calculate the number of centroids(We can mention that while creating the index) and assign each vector in the database to one of the centroid. Therefore while searching First we will calculate the distance to each of the centroid and will find the closest centroid. Then we will search with the elements in the list belongs to that centroid. So our search space gets reduced significantly.\n",
